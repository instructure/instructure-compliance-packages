Every day during the three-week cycle, Instructure's engineering team holds a “stand-up” meeting to review progress and discuss any concerns. Engineers write automated unit and integration tests to cover all new code that is written.\n B) All code changes are run through the full QA test suite and appropriately authorized before they can be accepted into the main product. Code changes are closely reviewed and must be peer-approved by other engineering team members before inclusion in the upgrade/update package.\n C) After the three-week development cycle, all changes are deployed to an internal staging server for additional QA testing. Instructure's QA team reviews all associated tickets, uses black-box testing of affected components, and also test standard application workflows. Notes are made on the internal tickets for these changes as needed. Any bugs that are found must be fixed during this QA period, otherwise the change is pulled for further development.\n D) Prior to release to the production environment, all upgrade/update packages are released to a non-production environment (by authorized staff) where the users of our client institutions can test drive and comment on new and changed features and functionality. Preliminary release notes are generated for the upcoming release and made available to all users at https://releases.instructure.com and updated during the QA process. Once the upgrade/update packages are ready for production, only authorized staff can deploy the changes.\n \n For more detail, Instructure's change management policies are outlined in our SOC 2 Type II reports, available for your review upon execution of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.",

For example, if a Critical security risk is detected that has a near-and-present-danger, fixing the vulnerability is given the highest priority by Instructure’s security and engineering teams and security patches as such will be applied within twenty-four (24) hours by best commercial efforts. In most cases, vulnerabilities can be fixed using a hot patch without incurring any downtime to production environments. Other patches to the operating system, application software, and code libraries are rated accordingly. The Overall Risk is calculated by taking the lesser of the two values. (e.g., if Likelihood = Low, and the Impact = High, the Overall Risk = Low). The Overall Risk is then used to prioritize the mitigation of vulnerabilities. We will not hesitate to raise a security risk-level where necessary for the safety and protection of our customers. As a SaaS platform, we have an industry-standard SLA for remediation of vulnerabilities. Our work remediating any vulnerabilities found is always at no additional cost to our customers.",
