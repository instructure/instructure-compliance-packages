As institutions strive to improve student outcomes, personalize learning experiences, and optimize resource allocation, the role of data analytics has become increasingly crucial. At Instructure, we recognize the power of data lies not just in its collection, but in the intelligent analysis that transforms raw information and statistics into actionable insights. This is why Intelligent Insights was born–a sophisticated product that harnesses the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide educators and administrators with unprecedented visibility into student performance, engagement, and potential. At its core is the innovative AI-powered ‘Ask Your Data’ feature that allows users to interact with their data in natural language. This means educators can ask complex questions about student trends, correlations, and predictions, receiving instant, data-backed responses that would traditionally require extensive manual analysis. By leveraging this intelligent analytics tool, educational institutions can uncover hidden patterns, identify at-risk students early, tailor interventions, and make data-informed decisions that significantly impact student success. The following supplemental document describes the Intelligent Insights architecture for those curious technical types who love getting into the detail of just how we improve educational outcomes for all. Hosting Instructure’s product family, including Intelligent Insights, is hosted in the cloud by Instructure and delivered over the internet through the world's most trusted public cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The basic building blocks of AWS include services such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Block Store (EBS), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Simple Email Service (SES), and Identity and Access Management (IAM). We also use advanced AWS platform capabilities including Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (“EKS”), and Amazon Relational Database Services (“RDS”). Instructure’s products are designed to make full use of the real-time redundancy and capacity capabilities offered by AWS, running across multiple availability zones in regions throughout the world. Primary storage is provided by Amazon S3, which is designed for durability exceeding 99.99999999%. Within Intelligent Insights, the Ask Your Data functionality is hosted by a third-party vendor which utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP is a leading cloud provider known for its advanced infrastructure and innovation in areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. Google’s expertise in these domains is a significant advantage to delivering the Ask Your Data functionality within Intelligent Insights. Hosting Regions For US customers, Intelligent Insights uses two Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensuring that client data is not stored outside of the United States: • AWS US East (Northern Virginia, us-east-1) • AWS US West (Oregon, us-west-2) For international clients, we use the following AWS regions: • AWS Canada Central (Montreal, ca-central-1) • AWS EU West (Ireland, eu-west-1) • AWS EU Central (Frankfurt, eu-central-1) • AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney, ap-southeast-2) • AWS Asia Pacific (Singapore, ap-southeast-1) In each region we operate, we utilize three (3) Availability Zones (AZ) for redundancy. Security Program Intelligent Insights is included as part of Instructure's robust information security program that runs on a continuous, PDCA-cycle. It was created based on guidance provided by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 and controls described in ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and is managed by Instructure's Chief Information Security and Privacy Officer (CISPO).
