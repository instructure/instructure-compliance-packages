 Development teams operate in either Scrum or Kanban teams organized around product components and features, with dedicated QA processes and personnel integral to each team. All functional code changes are required to be thoroughly reviewed and tested by one or more engineers other than the author. All code changes are also required to have appropriate automated tests written before the change is accepted, both for new features and bug fixes. 
 
 Once new code has passed peer review, the code is incorporated into the code base and submitted to testing and quality assurance. The new code is deployed to a continuous integration server where it is immediately tested. Instructure's testing team runs the following types of tests: 
 _ Unit tests (testing code with code)
 _ Integration tests (testing code with integrations with other code)
 _ Browser tests (testing how code works in the browser) on all the different environments and across different databases.
 
 After passing these tests, the code is incorporated in the master code branch for formal quality assurance. The QA team tests the new code on all supported platforms and browsers. Any bugs, flaws, defects or security issues that are found must be fixed during this formal QA period, otherwise the change is pulled for further development."

Provide links to these documents in Additional Information or attach them with your submission.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
PPPR-02	Do you have a documented patch management process?	Yes	"Regular vulnerability scans of our applications and our infrastructure are conducted using third-party tools, custom scripts, and various open source tools. If any vulnerabilities are detected, Instructure's security and engineering teams work together to analyze, design, and develop the required patch. At Instructure, we assess security risks based on two factors: Impact and Likelihood.
 
 _ Impact: Impact is the perceived, calculated, or actual impact that might occur if the identified vulnerability is exploited.
 _ Likelihood: Likelihood is the probability of the vulnerability being exploited.
 
Each of these factors are then rated High, Medium, or Low. For example, if a High security risk is detected that has a near-and-present-danger, fixing the vulnerability is given the highest priority by Instructure’s security and engineering teams and security patches as such will be applied within twenty-four (24) hours by best commercial efforts. In most cases, vulnerabilities can be fixed using a hot patch without incurring any downtime to the Canvas production environment. Other patches to the operating system, application software, and code libraries are rated accordingly. The Overall Risk is calculated by taking the lesser of the two values. (e.g., if Likelihood = Low, and the Impact = High, the Overall Risk = Low). The Overall Risk is then used to prioritize the mitigation of vulnerabilities. We will not hesitate to raise a security risk-level where necessary for the safety and protection of our customers.
 
 Our vulnerability remediation timelines are as follows:
 _ Critical: ASAP (within commercially reasonable timeframe)
 _ High: Within 30 days
 _ Moderate: Within 90 days
 _ Low: Within 180 days"	0
