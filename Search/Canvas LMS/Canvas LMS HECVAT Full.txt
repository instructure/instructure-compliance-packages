APPL-01	"Are access controls for institutional accounts based on structured rules, such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC) or policy-based access control (PBAC)?"	Yes	"Canvas LMS uses context-aware RBAC. Canvas administrators can create and customize bespoke user roles such as Administrators, Teachers, and TAs, based on their institutionÕs structure. Canvas administrators have over 170 granular permissions to choose from for these roles. Users are either granted account level rights and permissions (e.g. admins) or specific assigned course level roles (e.g. teacher, student, TA, etc.). Depending on their role, the user can have varying scopes of access based on the principle of least privilege. Users may hold multiple different roles (e.g. a student in one course and a teacher in another) without any escalation of privilege between those separate roles. There is also no requirement for users to have separate logins for their respective roles. User roles can be updated by Canvas administrators at any time, making role maintenance quick and efficient."

APPL-03	Does the system provide data input validation and error messages?	Yes	"Where specific data input is required, such as a date, word, or number, Canvas is capable of validating the data. Error messages related to the discrepancy will be displayed for the user. Canvas is built to be simple and give users all the resources they need to navigate the system efficiently. For added security, Canvas automatically sanitizes potentially malicious inputs from fields (such as scripts). This helps to protect Canvas from potential attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)."	Describe how your system(s) provide data input validation and error messages.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
APPL-04	Are you using a web application firewall (WAF)?	Yes	"We utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for all Canvas LMS instances. Canvas is also significantly hardened in a way that is already resistant to what a Web Application Firewall (WAF) would block. We conduct security auditing based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), perform third-party testing against the most critical and known security risks on an ongoing basis, and use both AWS Shield and AWS' autoscaling via Elastic Load Balancers to defend against attacks."	Describe the currently implemented WAF.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
APPL-05	"Do you have a process and implemented procedures for managing your software supply chain (e.g. libraries, repositories, frameworks, etc)"	Yes	"Managing our software supply chain forms part of our Vulnerability Management Policy.

APPL-11	Have your developers been trained in secure coding techniques?	Yes	"All Canvas developers are trained to identify and analyze security issues when writing and reviewing code. Members of the core security team and the engineering team subscribe to security-focused lists, blogs, and other resources to maintain, expand, and share the collective body of knowledge. Instructure maintains both an internal wiki and team-focused channels to discuss and share best practices for the mitigation and prevention of security pitfalls and vulnerabilities. The security and engineering teams keep up-to-date on general security practices, recent attack vectors, and on any security issues specifically related to the languages, web applications, frameworks, and environments that Instructure employs to develop, host, and maintain Canvas."	Summarize your secure coding training.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
APPL-12	Was your application developed using secure coding techniques?	Yes	"All code goes through a developer peer-review process before it is merged into the code base repository. On code commit, all application builds are automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities and must pass prior to deployment."	Summarize your secure coding practices.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
APPL-13	Do you subject your code to static code analysis and/or static application security testing prior to release?	Yes	"All code in Canvas goes through a developer peer-review process before it is merged into the code base repository. On code commit, all application builds are automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities and must pass prior to deployment.ÊStatic and dynamic code analysis is performed using a number of external and internal tools.Ê"	 Provide a list of all tools utilized during static code analysis or static application security testing.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
APPL-14	Do you have software testing processes (dynamic or static) that are established and followed?	Yes	"Instructure applies Agile principles and methodologies with an integrated Quality Assurance (QA) process to the design, development, and maintenance of our products. 
 
 Development teams operate in either Scrum or Kanban teams organized around product components and features, with dedicated QA processes and personnel integral to each team. All functional code changes are required to be thoroughly reviewed and tested by one or more engineers other than the author. All code changes are also required to have appropriate automated tests written before the change is accepted, both for new features and bug fixes. 
 
 Once new code has passed peer review, the code is incorporated into the code base and submitted to testing and quality assurance. The new code is deployed to a continuous integration server where it is immediately tested. Instructure's testing team runs the following types of tests: 
 _ Unit tests (testing code with code)
 _ Integration tests (testing code with integrations with other code)
 _ Browser tests (testing how code works in the browser) on all the different environments and across different databases.
 
 After passing these tests, the code is incorporated in the master code branch for formal quality assurance. The QA team tests the new code on all supported platforms and browsers. Any bugs, flaws, defects or security issues that are found must be fixed during this formal QA period, otherwise the change is pulled for further development."

CHNG-04	Do clients have the option to not participate in or postpone an upgrade to a new release?	Yes	"Wide ranging features (e.g. those that significantly update the workflow for common activities in Canvas) are deployed as Feature Options. Feature Options allow administrators to choose when they want to enable the new feature for the institution. Most institutions will pilot the feature within their non-production environment and then enable it for release between terms in order to give teachers time to understand and incorporate the feature into their everyday Canvas use. Minor updates, which include minor changes to non-critical areas of the system, are not able to be postponed since these are often required security patches, bug fixes, and miscellaneous updates between feature release drops."	Provide reference the the process/procedure to manage releases.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
CHNG-05	Do you have a fully implemented solution support strategy that defines how many concurrent versions you support?

Provide a reference to your technology roadmap.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
CHNG-09	Is Institution involvement (i.e. technically or organizationally) required during product updates?	No	"Updates are pushed to non-production and production environments without requiring any resource from an institution's IT staff or faculty, which means our customers can focus their time on the important task of excellence in teaching and learning instead of software maintenance. New features and major changes are first released as opt-in features, giving each institution the ability to implement or test changes on a schedule that best suits them. As versionless software, Canvas ensures all institutions have access to the same features while maintaining the flexibility to use them in a manner that best fits each organization's individual needs."	 	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
CHNG-10	"Do you have policy and procedure, currently implemented, managing how critical patches are applied to all systems and applications?"	Yes	"We assess security risks based on two factors: Impact (perceived, calculated, or actual impact that might occur if the identified vulnerability is exploited) and likelihood (probability of the vulnerability being exploited). These two factors allow us to categorize the severity of issues. Our vulnerability remediation timelines are as follows:
 ¥ Critical: ASAP (within commercially reasonable timeframe)
 ¥ High: Within 30 days
 ¥ Moderate: Within 90 days

 1. Identifies threats and risks that may affect our assets.
 2. Assesses threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, based on the probability of occurrence and the impact. Using this information we assign it an ""Overall Risk"" value.
 3. Mitigates risks according to each risk's respective Overall Risk value.
 4. Monitors mitigation mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of each mitigation plan on each risk over time. Additional mitigation mechanisms may be required to continue to drive down the likelihood and/or impact of each risk."	Summarize the policy and procedure(s) guiding risk mitigation practices before critical patches can be applied.	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
CHNG-12	Are upgrades or system changes installed during off-peak hours or in a manner that does not impact the customer?	Yes	"Canvas is upgraded twice a month, with a two-hour window of maintenance between the hours of 12:05am and 4:05am in a customer's local time zone. The maintenance window is an indication only; often updates only take minutes to complete with little to no downtime required. If there are no updates, no maintenance is performed."	" Define current off-peak hours, including time zones as necessary."	 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
CHNG-13	Do procedures exist to provide that emergency changes are documented and authorized (including after the fact approval)?

Data		Vendor Answers	Additional Information	Guidance	Analyst Notes																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
DATA-01	"Does the environment provide for dedicated single-tenant capabilities? If not, describe how your product or environment separates data from different customers (e.g., logically, physically, single tenancy, multi-tenancy)."	No	"Canvas LMS is a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS). Separation of tenants is accomplished via logical separation in what is natively multi-tenant software. Customer data is segregated via database partitioning. This partitioning is based on real-world aspect of the data (e.g. segmented by customer) and data cannot leak from one partition to another, nor can clients gain access to data in another partition as the method of inferring the client partition is accomplished after authentication. As client credentials are only valid for a single account, and therefore partition, user authentication is intrinsically tied to the partition identity. Validation of segregated client data occurs during weekly disaster recovery testing."	Describe your plan to separate institution data from other customers.

PPPR-02	Do you have a documented patch management process?	Yes	"Regular vulnerability scans of the Canvas LMS application and our infrastructure are conducted using third-party tools, custom scripts, and various open source tools. If any vulnerabilities are detected, Instructure's security and engineering teams work together to analyze, design, and develop the required patch. At Instructure, we assess security risks based on two factors: Impact and Likelihood.
 
 _ Impact: Impact is the perceived, calculated, or actual impact that might occur if the identified vulnerability is exploited.
 _ Likelihood: Likelihood is the probability of the vulnerability being exploited.
 
Each of these factors are then rated High, Medium, or Low. For example, if a High security risk is detected that has a near-and-present-danger, fixing the vulnerability is given the highest priority by InstructureÕs security and engineering teams and security patches as such will be applied within twenty-four (24) hours by best commercial efforts. In most cases, vulnerabilities can be fixed using a hot patch without incurring any downtime to the Canvas production environment. Other patches to the operating system, application software, and code libraries are rated accordingly. The Overall Risk is calculated by taking the lesser of the two values. (e.g., if Likelihood = Low, and the Impact = High, the Overall Risk = Low). The Overall Risk is then used to prioritize the mitigation of vulnerabilities. We will not hesitate to raise a security risk-level where necessary for the safety and protection of our customers.

The purpose of the policy is to describe Instructure's overarching security policy for protecting and securing Instructure's assets. Assets include, but are not limited to data, people, buildings, systems, applications, mechanisms, processes, and use of third parties. The policy also instantiates Instructure's security program, which is a systematic approach to establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving Instructure's security program (and supporting processes). Instructure's security policy and program are created based on guidance provided by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 and controls described in ISO/IEC 27001:2013. Instructure is ISO 27001:2013 certified and maintains a SOC 2 Type II report for Canvas LMS."

Yes	"Instructure maintains an access policy for the provisioning of all user accounts. This policy is reviewed annually. User account access is reviewed quarterly. The policy is based on the principle of least privilege, meaning we only grant users access confined to their authorized role requirements. Users are on-boarded with a default set of base permissions to low-risk functions. Permissions above the base set of permissions requires a documented request and approval prior to provisioning access. All access - including privileged access - is logged, audited and reviewed regularly. Users who are transferred to a new position or department have their existing level of access and permissions reviewed and adjusted (as needed) to retain only the permissions necessary for the new position. Terminated employee user identifiers, authenticators, and permissions are disabled immediately when an employee leaves the organisation."

The security team conducts thorough, comprehensive, prescriptive, internal security audits. In these audits, the security team:
 ¥ Scans the application externally, using both off-the-shelf and custom internally-built tools.
 ¥ Documents potential vulnerabilities, recommends fixes, and implements the most advantageous fix. The fixes are then retested, by both the original discoverer(s) and other, new-to-the-problem team members.
