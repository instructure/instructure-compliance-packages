 In brief, Instructure's policy ensures that our Security team:
 
 1. Identifies threats and risks that may affect our assets (including personnel, systems, data, processes, buildings, and other assets).
 
 2. Assess threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, based on the likelihood (probability) of occurrence and the impact, that would affect the assets identified above. During this process, Instructure assesses a threats likelihood of occurring and the impact of the potential risk. Using this information we assign it an 'Overall Risk' value.
 
 3. Mitigate risks according to each risk's respective Overall Risk value.
 
 4. Monitor mitigation mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of each mitigation plan on each risk over time. Additional mitigation mechanisms may be required to continue to drive down the likelihood and/or impact of each risk."

Prior to using any third party and on an annual basis thereafter, Instructure’s security team performs a security review of these vendors. Included as part of this review, the security team requests a copy of the third party's SOC 2 Type 2 report. If any exceptions or other issues are noted in these reports, the security team follows up as necessary to determine scope and impact. If a SOC 2 Type 2 report is not available, the security team provides the third party with questions related to the types of data, how those data elements are handled, and additional queries related to the status of security controls and processes implemented in the environment where data flow. Lastly, contractual obligations are put in place between Instructure and the third party to ensure security practices are in place and operating effectively."
