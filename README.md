1. `cd` to the `instructure-security-package` folder
2. Run `pnpm i` for inital setup
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start local server
4. Edit allthethings
5. Run `pnpm push` when finished (deploys to `gh-pages` branch and serves at inst.bid).

**Protip:** use `pnpm preview` to test the statically generated version before `push`ing.
